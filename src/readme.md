# Note:
*Whenever saving code to here, simply upload the pde files into this file, I will assimilate everything into the three pde files in the MusikHelfer folder later and then delete the assimilated pde files. Its also a good idea to add all of the code in the MusikHelfer folder into your personal pde files on your computers periodically to stay up to date with any changes -Ethan Tang*
*11/13/25 9:20 PM: I'm pretty sure that some was Simon's work was accidentally deleted, or rather, replaced by Mo when uploading his files to the MusikHelfer folder, so just as a reminder, remember add all of your code as a seperate folder into the github when updating like Kai did today:*
