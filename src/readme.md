# Note:
*Whenever saving code to here, simply upload the pde files into this file, I will assimilate everything into the three pde files in the MusikHelfer folder later and then delete the assimilated pde files. Its also a good idea to add all of the code in the MusikHelfer folder into your personal pde files on your computers periodically to stay up to date with any changes -Ethan Tang*
